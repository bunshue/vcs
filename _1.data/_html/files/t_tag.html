<h3><a name="what">What's new (in 2.4)</a></h3>
<blockquote>
Please check this section periodically to see what have been changed or
added. 
</blockquote>
<p>
<ul type=square>
    <li> This version is compiled and tested only on Unix.
<p>
    <li> The maximum number of digits the counter can count and display can
    be very high. The default is 80.  That is, there will not be any need 
    to recycle the datafile within your life time. If you want to change it, 
    edit the count.h and modify the directive MAX_DIGITS.
<p>
    <li> Wild card can be used in the IPs in ignore host block in the 
    config file.  There is no limit for number of IPs (as long as memory 
    is not exhausted).
<p>
    <li> Wild card can be used in the hosts/IPs in the auth block of the 
    config file.  There is no limit for number of hosts/IPs (as long as memory 
    is not exhausted).
<p>
    <li>The counter can count with image= parameter if df= parameter is
    specified.
<p>
<!-- added, Oct-25-1997 -->
    <li> Consecutive accesses from a host will not increment the counter.
<p>
<!-- added, Oct-26-1997 -->
    <li> New "cache" and expires" parameters can be used to change the
     caching behavior of certain browsers.
<p>
    <li> Date in clock is Year 2000 safe :)
<p>
    <li> Meaning of BLOCK 3 of the count.cfg file differes with that of
    Count 2.3. So if you'r using an older config file, change the boolean
    in this block.
<p>
    <li> Many bug fixes.
</ul>
<h3><A NAME="requ">
Requirements
</A></h3>
<ul>
<P>
<!--
The current version (2.3) works on unix, NT (intel), Win95,OS/2 and VMS.
The version 2.2 is ported to Mac by someone. It will be available If I can
obtain the distribution from the person.
-->
<p>
<LI> A C compiler (ANSI or non-ANSI).
<P>
<LI> You should be familiar with Unix operating system in order to install
it on Unix. I think if you know what <b>ls</b> command is, you qualify. If your
site is configured to run CGI programs from users' space, then you will 
not need root access otherwise root access is needed.
<P>
<LI> You must run a web server. The web server must be capable of running
CGI programs. If you run several web servers in your domain, you can 
install the counter in one server and allow the users at other servers to 
access the counter remotely.
<p>
<LI>The web server must be running on any of the Unix, NT, OS/2, VMS or 
Amiga Operating System.
</ul>
<P>
<blockquote>
It is reported that the Count 2.3 runs on the following platforms, 
hopefully 2.4 will be portable as well.

<h3><A NAME="intr">
Introduction
</A></h3>
<blockquote>
This is a 
<A HREF="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi">CGI</A>
program to keep record of the raw hits of a web page. It
generates a GIF image of the number of hits and returns to the browser as
an in-lined image.  The program also has a run-time option not to show the digit
images, this way the hits can be kept without displaying it. The hits can be
be monitored without incrementing from a separate page as well.
Almost all of the
<A HREF="#feat">features</A> are run-time options.
This program started as a fun to play
with CGI programming but due to enormous interest, feature request, input
from thousands of you, it has
turned in to the most configurable counter on the whole <b>World Wide
Web</b>. 
<P>
The program is distributed as a gzip'd tar archive. If you do not have
gzip/gunzip, it is available a tar archive at:
<a href="ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/gzip-1.2.4.tar">prep.ai.mit.edu</a>.
The URL is:
<code>ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/gzip-1.2.4.tar</code>

<p>
<li> Uses image strip as well as individual digit images. Using an image
strip reduces disk i/o significantly, therefore, it's faster. A program
(mkstrip) is supplied to create an image strip from individual digit images. 
<p>
<li> Comma can be displayed after every 3rd digit from right.
<p>
<li> Any one color of the image can be changed on the fly. 
<p>
<li> Uses netmasks to mask out a range of hosts in the network or the entire
network. 
<p>
<li> Automatic datafile creation, strict mode, use of rgb color database
can be controlled from the cfg file at run time. 
<p>
<li> Any arbitrary GIF file can be displayed. Frame and other attributes of
the counter can be applied to the GIF file. 
<P>
<LI> Count 2.0 is backward compatible with Count1.5's URL. One thing to
note, the keyword <b>wxh</b> has no meaning in Count 2.0. It was used in
Count 1.5 to specify digit dimensions. In Count 2.0 it is not required,
because the digit dimensions are determined automatically. Therefore, you
can use variable width digit images in this version.
<P>
<li> Reasonable default for all <b>QUERY_STRING</b> parameters.
<p>
<li> The same program can be used to display time or date.
<p>
<li> The time and date of any timezone in the world can be displayed. The
time can be displayed in 12 or in 24 hour format.
<p>
<li> Supports digit images with variable width.
<p>
<li> Counter can be displayed without incrementing (for monitoring etc.)
<p>
<li> A literal digit string can be displayed.
<p>
<li> A random digit string can be displayed.
<p>
<li> The color of the digits can be negated.
<p>
<li> The counter can be rotated (only integral of 90 degrees, 90,180,270).
The default rotation is 270 degrees.
<p>
<LI> An <B>ornamental 3D frame</B> can be wrapped around the counter image
with user defined thickness and color at <I>run time</I>.
<p>
<li> The frame and transparent color can be a name (e.g. red,green,pink
etc.). The color can be specified as a hex string, e.g. ffffff, ff0000 etc.
as well as RGB triplets as before.
<P>
<LI> Single program for any number of users for any number of web pages. 
<P>
<LI> Any color of the counter image can be made <B>transparent</B> at
<I>run time</I>.
<P>
<LI> Style of digits can be specified at <I>run time</I>.
<P>
<LI> Authorized host names can be in the configuration file.  Authorized
hosts are those which can run the counter remotely. Do not confuse this with
visitors from certain hosts.
<P>
<LI> IP filtering through a configuration file at <I>run time</I>. Any number of
hosts can be ignored from counting. A netmask can be used to filter out a
specific range of host in a network or to filter out the entire network.
It's a good idea to ignore your own host or entire domain. Gen-conf program
will let you create the configuration file interactively.
<P>
<LI><b>Data file locking</b>. Data file will not get clobbered by
simultaneous Count.cgi processes. 
<P>
<LI> Maximum number of digits can be set or counter can be displayed with
exact number of digits at <I>run time</I>.
<P>
<LI> User will be able to specify a start-up counter value at <I>run
time</I>. This will take effect if the data file does not exist. You will
be prompted by the configuration program if you want this feature or not.
<P>
<LI> If you <b>do not want to display the counter</b> but like to keep the
hits on your page, sh=0 can be defined in the QUERY_STRING at <I>run time</I>.
It will write a 1x1 transparent GIF image to the browser but the counter in the
data file will be incremented all right.

Directory Structure (unix)
</a></h3>
<blockquote>
Before going to the configuration procedure, please browse through
the default directory structure below. It will help you answering questions
of the configuration script. You can change the name of the directories
as you please, but keep the directory structure same, it will make your
life much easier. You do not have to create any of these directories, they
will be created for you by the Count-install program. Only thing you 
probably have to create are the individual datafiles (keep reading).
<p>
<img src="images/countdst.gif" border=1 alt="directory structure">
<p>
<b>Base Directory</b> is the directory where all the sub-directories and
the files related to counter reside. 
<p>
<b>Log Directory</b> is the directory which holds the counter Log file.
Counter error messages or if someone tries to access your counter remotely,
warning message regarding this is written to this file.
<p>
<b>conf</b> directory holds the configuration file for the counter. 
configuration file holds information in 4 blocks. Each
block resides between a left and right curly brace. 
This file is created by the program <b>Gen-conf</b> and can be hand crafted
later. After creating the file, please read the comments in the file.
<p>
<b>data</b> directory holds all the datafiles for the counter. The datafiles
stores the access counts of web pages. Each page must have a separate
datafile. The datafile is specified at run-time. You will know about it
later.
<p>
<b>digits</b> directory holds sub-directories with various styles of GIF
digits. For example, <b>A</b> sub-directory holds the green led digits.
The sub-directories have GIF digit files named zero.gif, one.gif...nine.gif.
you will know about it later.
<p>
<b>rgb.txt</b> file is used to convert a color name (for example, cyan) to the
appropriate red, green and blue color component. This file came from 
X consortium and supplied with the distribution. You will know about the
file later.
