There was a bomb scare on an Air France flight on Sunday. The plane was flying from the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius to Paris. A passenger found a strange-looking device made from a kitchen timer, cardboard and paper in a toilet. They alerted staff and the pilot decided to make an emergency landing in the Kenyan port city of Mombasa, which was the nearest airport. Air France's CEO Frederic Gagey said the device was harmless and caused a "false alarm". He said that someone probably put it in the toilet at some point during the flight. Mr Gagey added: "All the information available to us at the moment indicates that the object was not capable of creating an explosion or damaging a plane."
