# Viewers

These are traditional medical viewers for working with pydicom. If you have a general visualization or are looking for examples that are not fitting to this category, you might considering looking at [plotting and visualization](../plotting-visualization).

 - [imViewer_Simple.py](imViewer_Simple.py): An example program that opens uncompressed DICOM images and converts them via numPy and PIL to be viewed in wxWidgets GUI apps. See the script header for more information.
 - [pydicom_Tkinter.py](pydicom_Tkinter.py): viewer that uses Tkinter.
 - [pydicom_PIL.py](pydicom_PIL.py): a viewer that uses PIL (Python Image Library)
