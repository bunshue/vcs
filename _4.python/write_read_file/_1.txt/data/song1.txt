Monsters University
We give our heart to you
We want you to be proud of us
What ever we may do.
Wherever children are dreaming,
We'll bring the nightmares to
From Monsters University
Alma Mater we love you.

Monsters of the world
Can you hear the call?
At Monsters University
You're welcome one and all
Monster University, Monster University
First in terror, first in fear,
We're awfully glad we're here.

Monsters University
We never will forget
The golden years we spent with you
And the monster that we met
No matter where life takes us
Your light will come shining through
Oh, Monsters University
Alma Mater, hail to you.
