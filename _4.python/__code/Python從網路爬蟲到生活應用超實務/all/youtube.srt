1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,589

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:07,470
subtitles for your YouTube videos well

3
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:10,710
subtitles is not new to video in fact

4
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:13,290
most films before 1930 were silent and

5
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:16,289
use captions with video to really tell

6
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:17,880
the story now Charlie Chaplin was the

7
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:20,580
man he didn't even have to say a word

8
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:22,769
and he was able to really captivate an

9
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:24,779
audience and in this video I'm going to

10
00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:26,880
show you how to create captions or

11
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:29,490
subtitles for your YouTube videos and

12
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:32,610
this can really be powerful because

13
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:35,250
adding captions can really increase user

14
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:36,750
engagement and also make that video to

15
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:42,360
rank a little bit higher in the search

16
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:43,829
engines let's take a look all right to

17
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,600
add that really important transcription

18
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:47,219
to your video what you want to do is to

19
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,670
Mouse up to the upper right hand corner

20
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:51,780
mouse over to video manager and once

21
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:54,000
you're there you need to select the

22
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:56,280
video and hit the edit button that you

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,920
want to add that transcription to once

24
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,770
you're here you need to see the trend of

25
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:05,489
the captions tab here click on that and

26
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:08,390
what happens is YouTube automatically

27
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:11,010
makes captions and they're not very good

28
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:12,659
because it has a very difficult time all

29
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:15,659
the speak a little bit differently and

30
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:18,900
they do a horrible job at doing it huge

31
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:21,090
task and so what we need to do is help

32
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:22,619
them out so the first thing is is you

33
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:24,900
actually have a script that you read

34
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:26,610
from you can actually just upload the

35
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,860
file just click this right here and just

36
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:31,470
upload the file really easy it will just

37
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:33,210
sync and it's super easy now if you

38
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:35,520
don't you can go ahead and hit the

39
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:37,530
transcribe and sync now this is where

40
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,079
it's really cool and YouTube's making it

41
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:41,460
really easy for all of us to transcribe

42
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,590
our videos to make you the search

43
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:46,380
engines easier to to know what we're

44
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:49,259
saying so the great thing about it is

45
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:52,710
you can actually have the video start

46
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:54,990
playing take a few minutes and leave my

47
00:01:52,710 --> 00:02:00,979
office get away from the game and as you

48
00:01:54,990 --> 00:02:00,979
start typing it stops the video tickle

49
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:06,840
justtake now the great thing about it

50
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:10,230
too is if you hit shift and the left

51
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:12,450
arrow it takes it back five seconds and

52
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:16,140
then also I'm going to just pause it

53
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:18,690
here also you can hit shift + the space

54
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:20,400
key and it actually pauses it so I'm

55
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:22,140

56
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,420
and this is where you can go around and

57
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:26,640
play with it a little bit but I'm going

58
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:28,380
