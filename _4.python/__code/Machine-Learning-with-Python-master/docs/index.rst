Complexity and Learning curve analysis
===========================================
Complexity and learning curve analyses are essentially are part of the visual analytics that a data scientist must perform using the available dataset for comparing the merits of various ML algorithms.

**Learning curve**: Graphs that compares the performance of a model on training and testing data over a varying number of training instances. We should generally see performance improve as the number of training points increases.

**Complexity curve**: Graphs that show the model performance over training and validation set for varying degree of model complexity (e.g. degree of polynomial for linear regression, number of layers or neurons for neural networks, number of estimator trees for a Boosting algorithm or Random Forest).

Object-oriented programming with machine learning
===========================================================

Implementing some of the core OOP principles in a machine learning
context by `building your own Scikit-learn-like estimator, and making it
better <https://github.com/tirthajyoti/Machine-Learning-with-Python/blob/master/OOP_in_ML/Class_MyLinearRegression.ipynb>`__.

`Here is the complete Python script with the linear regression
class <https://github.com/tirthajyoti/Machine-Learning-with-Python/blob/master/OOP_in_ML/Class_MyLinearRegression.py>`__,
which can do fitting, prediction, cpmputation of regression metrics,
plot outliers, plot diagnostics (linearity, constant variance, etc.),
compute variance inflation factors.

I created a Python package based on this work, which offers simple Scikit-learn style interface API along with deep statistical inference and residual analysis capabilities for linear regression problems. `Check it out here <https://mlr.readthedocs.io>`__.

See my articles on Medium on this topic.
