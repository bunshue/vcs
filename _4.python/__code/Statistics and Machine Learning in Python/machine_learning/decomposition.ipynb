    "In machine learning and statistics, dimensionality reduction or dimension reduction is the process of reducing the number of features under consideration, and can be divided into feature selection (not addressed here) and feature extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature extraction starts from an initial set of measured data and builds derived values (features) intended to be informative and non-redundant, facilitating the subsequent learning and generalization steps, and in some cases leading to better human interpretations. Feature extraction is related to dimensionality reduction.\n",

    "### Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "- Principal components analysis is the main method used for linear dimension reduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The idea of principal component analysis is to find the $K$ **principal components directions** (called the **loadings**) $\\mathbf{V}_{K\\times P}$ that capture the variation in the data as much as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It converts a set of $N$ $P$-dimensional observations $\\mathbf{N}_{N\\times P}$ of possibly correlated variables into a set of $N$ $K$-dimensional samples  $\\mathbf{C}_{N\\times K}$, where the $K < P$. The new variables are linearly uncorrelated. The columns of $\\mathbf{C}_{N\\times K}$ are called the **principal components**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The dimension reduction is obtained by using only $K < P$ components that exploit correlation (covariance) among the original variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "- PCA is mathematically defined as an orthogonal linear transformation $\\mathbf{V}_{K\\times P}$ that transforms the data to a new coordinate system such that the greatest variance by some projection of the data comes to lie on the first coordinate (called the first principal component), the second greatest variance on the second coordinate, and so on.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{C}_{N\\times K} = \\mathbf{X}_{N \\times P} \\mathbf{V}_{P \\times K} \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- PCA can be thought of as fitting a $P$-dimensional ellipsoid to the data, where each axis of the ellipsoid represents a principal component. If some axis of the ellipse is small, then the variance along that axis is also small, and by omitting that axis and its corresponding principal component from our representation of the dataset, we lose only a commensurately small amount of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Finding the $K$ largest axes of the ellipse will permit to project the data onto a space having dimensionality $K < P$ while maximizing the variance of the projected data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Centering\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a data matrix, $\\mathbf{X}$ , with column-wise zero empirical mean (the sample mean of each column has been shifted to zero), ie. $\\mathbf{X}$ is replaced by $\\mathbf{X} - \\mathbf{1}\\bar{\\mathbf{x}}^T$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Standardizing\n",
    "\n",
    "Optionally, standardize the columns, i.e., scale them by their standard-deviation. Without standardization, a variable with a high variance will capture most of the effect of the PCA. The principal direction will be aligned with this variable. Standardization will, however, raise noise variables to the save level as informative variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The covariance matrix of centered standardized data is the correlation matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Eigendecomposition of the data covariance matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin with, consider the projection onto a one-dimensional space ($K = 1$). We can define the direction of this space using a $P$-dimensional vector $\\mathbf{v}$, which for convenience (and without loss of generality) we shall choose to be a unit vector so that $\\|\\mathbf{v}\\|_2 = 1$ (note that we are only interested in the direction defined by $\\mathbf{v}$, not in the magnitude of $\\mathbf{v}$ itself). PCA consists of two mains steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Projection in the directions that capture the greatest variance**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each $P$-dimensional data point $\\mathbf{x}_i$ is then projected onto $\\mathbf{v}$, where the coordinate (in the coordinate system of $\\mathbf{v}$) is a scalar value, namely $\\mathbf{x}_i^T \\mathbf{v}$. I.e., we want to find the vector $\\mathbf{v}$ that maximizes these coordinates along $\\mathbf{v}$, which we will see corresponds to maximizing the variance of the projected data. This is equivalently expressed as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{v} = \\arg \\max_{\\|\\mathbf{v}\\|=1}\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_i \\left(\\mathbf{x}_i^T \\mathbf{v}\\right)^2.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can write this in matrix form as\n",
    "\n",

Clearly, this has to be a constrained maximization to prevent $\\|\\mathbf{v}_2\\| \\rightarrow \\infty$. The appropriate constraint comes from the normalization condition $\\|\\mathbf{v}\\|_2 \\equiv \\|\\mathbf{v}\\|_2^2 = \\mathbf{v}^T \\mathbf{v} = 1$. To enforce this constraint, we introduce a [Lagrange multiplier](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus/applications-of-multivariable-derivatives/constrained-optimization/a/lagrange-multipliers-single-constraint) that we shall denote by $\\lambda$, and then make an unconstrained maximization of\n",

    "We can define additional principal components in an incremental fashion by choosing each new direction to be that which maximizes the projected variance amongst all possible directions that are orthogonal to those already considered.
