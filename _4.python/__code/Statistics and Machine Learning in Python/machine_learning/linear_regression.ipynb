    "In statistics and machine learning, overfitting occurs when a statistical model describes random errors or noise instead of the underlying relationships. Overfitting generally occurs when a model is **excessively complex**, such as having **too many parameters relative to the number of observations**. A model that has been overfit will generally have poor predictive performance, as it can exaggerate minor fluctuations in the data.\n",

    "\n",
    "Predictors are highly correlated, meaning that one can be linearly predicted from the others. In this situation the coefficient estimates of the multiple regression may change erratically in response to small changes in the model or the data. Multicollinearity does not reduce the predictive power or reliability of the model as a whole, at least not within the sample data set; it only affects computations regarding individual predictors. That is, a multiple regression model with correlated predictors can indicate how well the entire bundle of predictors predicts the outcome variable, but it may not give valid results about any individual predictor, or about which predictors are redundant with respect to others. In case of perfect multicollinearity the predictor matrix is singular and therefore cannot be inverted. Under these circumstances, for a general linear model $\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{w} + \\boldsymbol{\\varepsilon}$, the ordinary least-squares estimator, $\\mathbf{w}_{OLS} = (\\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{X})^{-1}\\mathbf{X}^T \\mathbf{y}$, does not exist.\n",

    "High dimensions means a large number of input features. Linear predictor associate one parameter to each input feature, so a high-dimensional situation ($P$, number of features, is large) with a relatively small number of samples $N$ (so-called large $P$ small $N$ situation) generally lead to an overfit of the training data. Thus it is generally a bad idea to add many input features into the learner. This phenomenon is called the **curse of dimensionality**.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most important criteria to use when choosing a learning algorithm is based on the relative size of $P$ and $N$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Remenber that the \"covariance\" matrix $\\mathbf{X}^T\\mathbf{X}$ used in the linear model is a $P \\times P$ matrix of rank $\\min(N, P)$. Thus if $P > N$ the equation system is overparameterized and admit an infinity of solutions that might be specific to the learning dataset. See also ill-conditioned or singular matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The sampling density of $N$ samples in an $P$-dimensional space is proportional to $N^{1/P}$. Thus a high-dimensional space becomes very sparse, leading to poor estimations of samples densities. To preserve a constant density, an exponential growth in the number of observations is required. 50 points in 1D, would require 2 500 points in 2D and 125 000 in 3D!\n",
    "\n",
    "- Another consequence of the sparse sampling in high dimensions is that all sample points are close to an edge of the sample. Consider $N$ data points uniformly distributed in a $P$-dimensional unit ball centered at the origin. Suppose we consider a nearest-neighbor estimate at the origin. The median distance from the origin to the closest data point is given by the expression: $d(P, N) = \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{2}^{1/N}\\right)^{1/P}.$\n",

    "A more complicated expression exists for the mean distance to the closest point. For N = 500, P = 10 , $d(P, N ) \\approx 0.52$, more than halfway to the boundary. Hence most data points are closer to the boundary of the sample space than to any other data point. The reason that this presents a problem is that prediction is much more difficult near the edges of the training sample. One must extrapolate from neighboring sample points rather than interpolate between them.\n",

These models are difficult to interpret because covariates that are strongly associated with the outcome are not included in the predictive model. Conversely, the elastic net encourages a grouping effect, where strongly correlated predictors tend to be in or out of the model together.\n",
