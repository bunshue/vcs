    "In  **parallel methods**  we fit the different considered learners independently from each others and, so, it is possible to train them concurrently. The most famous such approach is “bagging” (standing for “**b**ootstrap **agg**regat**ing**”) that aims at producing an ensemble model that is  **more robust**  than the individual models composing it.\n",

    "\n",
    "The idea of bagging is then simple: we want to fit several independent models and “average” their predictions in order to obtain a model with a lower variance. However, we can’t, in practice, fit fully independent models because it would require too much data. So, we rely on the good “approximate properties” of bootstrap samples (representativity and independence) to fit models that are almost independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we create **multiple bootstrap samples** so that each new bootstrap sample will act as another (almost) independent dataset drawn from true distribution. Then, we can  **fit a weak learner for each of these samples and finally aggregate them such that we kind of “average” their outputs**  and, so, obtain an ensemble model with **less variance** that its components. Roughly speaking, as the bootstrap samples are approximatively **independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.)**, so are the learned base models. Then, **“averaging” weak learners outputs** do not change the expected answer but reduce its variance.\n",

    "## Boosting\n",
    "\n",
    "In  **sequential methods**  the different combined weak models are **no longer** fitted **independently** from each others. The idea is to fit models  **iteratively**  such that the training of model at a given step depends on the models fitted at the previous steps. “Boosting” is the most famous of these approaches and it produces an ensemble model that is in general **less biased** than the weak learners that compose it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Boosting** methods work in the same **spirit** as **bagging** methods: we build a **family of models** that are **aggregated** to obtain a strong learner that performs better.\n",
    "\n",
    "**However**, **unlike bagging that mainly aims at reducing variance, boosting is a technique that consists in fitting sequentially multiple weak learners in a very adaptative** way: **each model in the sequence is fitted giving more importance to observations in the dataset that were badly handled by the previous models** in the sequence. Intuitively, each new model  **focus its efforts on the most difficult observations**  to fit up to now, so that we obtain, **at the end of the process**, a strong learner with **lower bias** (even if we can notice that boosting can also have the effect of reducing variance).\n",
    "\n",
    "--> Boosting, like bagging, can be used for regression as well as for classification problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Being  **mainly focused at reducing bias**, the **base models** that are often considered for boosting are* *models with low variance but high bias**. For example, if we want to use **trees** as our base models, we will choose **most of the time shallow decision trees with only a few depths.**\n",
    "\n",
    " Another important reason that motivates the use of low variance but high bias models as weak learners for boosting is that these models are in general less computationally expensive to fit (few degrees of freedom when parametrised). Indeed, as computations to fit the different models  **can’t be done in parallel**  (unlike bagging), it could become too expensive to fit sequentially several complex models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the weak learners have been chosen, we still need to define **how** they will be sequentially **fitted** and **how** they will be **aggregated**. We will discuss these questions in the two following subsections, describing more especially two important boosting algorithms: **adaboost** and **gradient boosting**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a nutshell, these two meta-algorithms **differ** on how they **create and aggregate** the weak learners during the sequential process. **Ada**ptive **boost**ing **updates the weights attached to each of the training dataset observations** whereas **gradient boosting updates the value of these observations**. This main difference comes from the way both methods try to **solve the optimisation** problem of finding the best model that can be written as a weighted sum of weak learners.\n",

More especially, we **add** the **weak learners one by one**, looking at each iteration for the **best possible pair** (**coefficient, weak learner**) to add to the current ensemble model.

    "\n",
    "More especially, when considering a **binary classification**, we can show that the adaboost algorithm can be re-written into a process that proceeds as follow. First, it updates the **observations weights** in the dataset and train a new weak learner with a **special focus** given to the **observations misclassified** by the current ensemble model.

    "So, assume that we want to use gradient boosting technique with a given family of weak models.

Notice that, **while adaptative boosting tries to solve at each iteration exactly the “local” optimisation problem (find the best weak learner and its coefficient to add to the strong model), gradient boosting uses instead a gradient descent approach and can more easily be adapted to large number of loss functions**. Thus, **gradient boosting** can be considered as a **generalization of adaboost to arbitrary differentiable loss functions**.\n",

    "\n",
    "As we already mentioned, the idea of stacking is to learn several different weak learners and  **combine them by training a meta-model**  to output predictions based on the multiple predictions returned by these weak models. So, we need to define two things in order to build our stacking model: the L learners we want to fit and the meta-model that combines them.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, for a classification problem, we can choose as weak learners a KNN classifier, a logistic regression and a SVM, and decide to learn a neural network as meta-model. Then, the neural network will take as inputs the outputs of our three weak learners and will learn to return final predictions based on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, assume that we want to fit a stacking ensemble composed of L weak learners. Then we have to follow the steps thereafter:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   split the **training data in two folds**\n",
    "-   choose **L weak learners** and **fit** them to data of the **first fold**\n",
    "-   for each of the L weak learners, **make predictions** for observations in the **second fold**\n",
    "-   fit the **meta-model** on the **second fold**, using **predictions made by the weak learners as inputs**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous steps, we split the dataset in two folds because predictions on data that have been used for the training of the weak learners are  **not relevant for the training of the meta-model**.\n",
