    "# Classification with XGBoost\n",
    "\n",
    "> This chapter will introduce you to the fundamental idea behind XGBoostâ€”boosted learners. Once you understand how XGBoost works, you'll apply it to solve a common classification problem found in industry - predicting whether a customer will stop being a customer at some point in the future. This is the Summary of lecture \"Extreme Gradient Boosting with XGBoost\", via datacamp.\n",

    "Your goal is to use the first month's worth of data to predict whether the app's users will remain users of the service at the 5 month mark. This is a typical setup for a churn prediction problem. To do this, you'll split the data into training and test sets, fit a small xgboost model on the training set, and evaluate its performance on the test set by computing its accuracy."
