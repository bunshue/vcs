    "# Cross Validation\n",
    "> Holdout sets are a great start to model validation. However, using a single train and test set if often not enough. Cross-validation is considered the gold standard when it comes to validating model performance and is almost always used when tuning model hyper-parameters. This chapter focuses on performing cross-validation to validate model performance. This is the Summary of lecture \"Model Validation in Python\", via datacamp.\n",
