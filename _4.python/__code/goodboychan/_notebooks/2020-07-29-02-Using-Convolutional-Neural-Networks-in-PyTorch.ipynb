It is your job as a data scientist to split the dataset into training, testing and validation. The easiest (and most used) way of doing so is to do a random splitting of the dataset. In PyTorch, that can be done using `SubsetRandomSampler` object. You are going to split the training part of MNIST dataset into training and validation. After randomly shuffling the dataset, use the first 55000 points for training, and the remaining 5000 points for validation."
