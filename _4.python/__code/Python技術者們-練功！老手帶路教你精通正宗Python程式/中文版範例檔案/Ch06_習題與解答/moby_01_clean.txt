call
me
ishmael
some
years
ago
never
mind
how
long
preciselyhaving
little
or
no
money
in
my
purse
and
nothing
particularto
interest
me
on
shore
i
thought
i
would
sail
about
a
littleand
see
the
watery
part
of
the
world
it
is
a
way
i
haveof
driving
off
the
spleen
and
regulating
the
circulationwhenever
i
find
myself
growing
grim
about
the
mouthwhenever
it
is
a
damp
drizzly
november
in
my
soul
whenever
ifind
myself
involuntarily
pausing
before
coffin
warehousesand
bringing
up
the
rear
of
every
funeral
i
meetand
especially
whenever
my
hypos
get
such
an
upper
hand
of
methat
it
requires
a
strong
moral
principle
to
prevent
me
fromdeliberately
stepping
into
the
street
and
methodically
knockingpeople's
hats
off
then
i
account
it
high
time
to
get
to
seaas
soon
as
i
can
this
is
my
substitute
for
pistol
and

is
nothing
surprising
in
thisif

very
nearly
the

now

your
insular
city

extreme
downtownis
the

where
that
noble
mole
is
washed
by
