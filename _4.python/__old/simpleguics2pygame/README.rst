==================
SimpleGUICS2Pygame
==================

It is primarily a standard Python_ (**2 and 3**) module
reimplementing the SimpleGUI particular module of CodeSkulptor2_ and CodeSkulptor3_
(a Python browser environment).
This is in fact a package also with other modules adapted from CodeSkulptor.

Simply change

.. code-block:: python

   import simplegui

by

.. code-block:: python

    try:
        import simplegui
    except ImportError:
        import SimpleGUICS2Pygame.simpleguics2pygame as simplegui

in your CodeSkulptor program
and your program **run both** in CodeSkulptor
and *standard Python* with this module (and Pygame).

(You can also see the online `SimpleGUI documentation on CodeSkulptor2`_
or `SimpleGUI documentation on CodeSkulptor3`_.)

If you have some problem
========================
First, read this short main `documentation page`_,
this Compatibility_ page
and this Tips_ page.

If you have problem with some command,
you can see its documentation in the `modules page`_.

Next, you can search in Stack Overflow.
If you don't find answer, you can ask question like this_.

Finally you can email me.
I will try to help you with pleasure.

Installation
============
Installation requires that Python tools are up to date.
If not, then see the `Online HTML documentation`_.
Else, simply do:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ python -m pip install SimpleGUICS2Pygame --user

Note that ``$`` represents the prompt and do *not* be entered by you.

If several Python implementations are installed,
maybe you must use something like ``python2`` or ``python3`` instead ``python`` command.

With the ``--user`` option
the installation is made in the user directory
and doesn't require administrator rights.


Normally all **requirements are automatically installed**.
But for that you need have ``pip`` and other installation packages installed
and up to date.

.. warning::
   If you have some installation problem
   see the complete information in `Online HTML documentation`_.



On Arch Linux you can use this package installation script (written by Danny Fajardo):
`Arch_Linux/PKGBUILD`_.

Examples of CodeSkulptor and SimpleGUICS2Pygame use
===================================================
You can see examples in `SimpleGUICS2Pygame/example/`_ subdirectory from the sources archives.

.. _`SimpleGUICS2Pygame/example/`: https://bitbucket.org/OPiMedia/simpleguics2pygame/src/master/SimpleGUICS2Pygame/example/

Or online:
`Python programs running in CodeSkulptor`_ .

Two simple online examples:
  * `Frame_example.py`_: very simple canvas example
  * `presentation.py`_: little draw images and texts

Note that
=========
* `SimpleGUI of CodeSkulptor2`_ (Scott Rixner) is a specific module of CodeSkulptor2_, written in JavaScript.

  CodeSkulptor is a Python implementation running **in a browser**.
  It implements a subset of Python **2**.
  It is the environment used in the course
  `An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python`_
  (Rice University, Coursera).

* `SimpleGUI of CodeSkulptor3`_ (Scott Rixner) is the same in the new version CodeSkulptor3_
  that implements a subset of Python **3**.

* **SimpleGUICS2Pygame** (Olivier Pirson) is **this package**.
  It is fully compatible with Python **2 and 3**.

  It contains
  ``codeskulptor``, ``numeric``, ``simpleguics2pygame`` and ``simpleplot`` modules
  that reimplement
  ``codeskulptor``, ``numeric``, ``simplegui`` and ``simpleplot`` modules of CodeSkulptor.

  .. warning::
     SimpleGUICS2Pygame was **designed to mimic behavior of CodeSkulptor**.
     So `load_image()`_ and `load_sound()`_ methods can load medias only from URL, not local files.
     However SimpleGUICS2Pygame can save these medias to a specific local directory.
     See the `Download medias`_ tips.

     You can also use *specific* `_load_local_image()`_ and `_load_local_sound()`_ methods
     to load local files. But be careful, each specific method doesn't exist in CodeSkulptor.

     There exist some **little differences between SimpleGUICS2Pygame and SimpleGUI** of CodeSkulptor.
     See Compatibility_ notes.

* SimpleGUITk_ (David Holm) is *another implementation* of SimpleGUI of CodeSkulptor, using Tkinter and some others packages. It is really less complete and not updated. However it works for some programs.

* simplequi_ (Arthur Gordon-Wright) is *another implementation* of SimpleGUI of CodeSkulptor, using Qt/PySide2. It is a partial implementation that I have not tested.

.. warning::
   * simplegui_ (Florian Berger) is a Python package which has the same name as SimpleGUI of CodeSkulptor, but it is *totally something else*.
