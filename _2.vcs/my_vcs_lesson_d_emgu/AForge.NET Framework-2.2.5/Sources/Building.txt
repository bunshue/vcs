AForge.NET framework building instructions
==========================================

To build the framework from sources it is required to have installation
of VS.NET 2010 (C#/C++ Express Edition 2010 is fine).

Each individual library of the framework has its own project file and
solution file, which allows building any of the libraries independently.
These individual solution files can be found in the appropriate folders
of the library.

Note: since this approach requires knowledge of dependencies between
framework’s libraries, it is supposed mostly for framework developers,
who work on individual projects.


To simplify build process and allow building of entire framework at once,
there is a main solution file – “Build All.sln”. This allows building all
libraries in correct order, so no dependency issues arise.


Important! To build all libraries right after checking out them from SVN
it is suggested to use "Release" solution configuration in VS.NET. It will
build all, except the AForge.Robotics.TeRK library, which requires ICE
framework to be installed (http://www.zeroc.com/ice.html).
